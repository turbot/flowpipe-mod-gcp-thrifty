# Detect & correct Kubernetes clusters exceeding max age

## Overview

Kubernetes clusters can be expensive to run, especially when they are not being used. This pipeline detects Kubernetes clusters that have exceeded a certain age and then either sends a notification or attempts to perform a predefined corrective action.

This pipeline detects kubernetes clusters that have exceeded a certain age and then either sends a notification or attempts to perform a predefined corrective action.

## Getting Started

This control will work out-of-the-box with some sensible defaults (configurable via [variables](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-variables)).

You should be able to simply run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run detect_and_correct_kubernetes_clusters_exceeding_max_age
```

By default, Flowpipe runs in [wizard](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/gcp_thrifty#wizard) mode and prompts directly in the terminal for a decision on the action(s) to take for each detected resource.

However, you can run Flowpipe in [server](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/server) mode with [external integrations](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/input#create-an-integration), allowing it to prompt for input via `http`, `slack`, `teams`, etc.

Alternatively, you can choose to configure and run in other modes:
* [Notify](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/gcp_thrifty#notify): Provides detections without taking any corrective action.
* [Automatic](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/gcp_thrifty#automatic): Performs corrective actions automatically without user intervention.
