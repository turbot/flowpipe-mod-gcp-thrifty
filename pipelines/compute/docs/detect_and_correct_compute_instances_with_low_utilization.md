# Detect & correct compute instances with low utilization

## Overview

compute instances with low utilization may be indicative that they're no longer required, these should be reviewed.

This pipeline detects compute instances with low average usage and then either sends a notification or attempts to perform a predefined corrective action.

## Getting Started

This control will work out-of-the-box with some sensible defaults (configurable via [variables](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-variables)).

You should be able to simply run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
flowpipe pipeline run detect_and_correct_compute_instances_with_low_utilization
```

By default, Flowpipe runs in [wizard](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/gcp_thrifty#wizard) mode and prompts directly in the terminal for a decision on the action(s) to take for each detected resource.

However, you can run Flowpipe in [server](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/server) mode with [external integrations](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/input#create-an-integration), allowing it to prompt for input via `http`, `slack`, `teams`, etc.

Alternatively, you can choose to configure and run in other modes:
* [Notify](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/gcp_thrifty#notify): Provides detections without taking any corrective action.
* [Automatic](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/gcp_thrifty#automatic): Performs corrective actions automatically without user intervention.
